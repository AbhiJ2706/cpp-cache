# cpp-cache

A c++ program representing a cache found in memory hierarchies. It can replicate direct-mapped, fully associative, and set associative caches.
It uses a least recently used replacement scheme. Each entry also has a valid bit and a dirty bit.

A makefile is included if you would like to compile/run this on your machine!

Example cache (captured directly from output of the program):
